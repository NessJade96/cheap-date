Created by Ruben Iacono, Nathan Loudon, Tanel Colak, and Vanessa Bloom

## MVP (minimum viable product)

Who is your audience? - People at home, aged over 18, wanting to experiment,
What is the problem that the product will address? - Recipe on how to make, cost involved,
How does the product solve that problem? - Informs how to make correct cocktails at home

## Description

As a person wanting to experiment with cocktails at home, I want to view a recipe and ingredients for my desired cocktail, so that I am informed on how to make it and how much it will cost.
