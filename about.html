	<div class="d-flex p-2 text-white col-sm-12 m-2 col-md-6">we are a bunch of university students currently learning coding! this website was built as one of our first projects, where we were given the task of incorporating
		the skills we've learnt throughout the past 6 weeks.
	</div>
	<div class="d-flex p-2 text-white col-sm-12 m-2 col-md-6">we wanted to create something that was fun and  easy to use, while informative at the same time. we realised that the vast majority of people who enjoy cocktails usually drink them when out at a restaurant of bar. but what if
		someone doesn't feel like going out just to enjoy their favourite cocktail? that's where we come in. 
	</div>
	<div class="d-flex p-2 text-white col-sm-12 m-2 col-md-6">we allow users to search for their favourite cocktail, browse the numerous recipes we have to offer, or create their own with the alcohol they already have! we not only display the recipe and required ingredients, but also 
		the average price the user would pay if they were to go out and buy everything they dont already have.
